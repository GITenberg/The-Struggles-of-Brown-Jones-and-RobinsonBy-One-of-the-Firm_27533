description: The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson is a satirical attack on
  abuses in advertising. Told by "One of the firm," it is the tale of a foolhardy
  junior partner of an ill-fated haberdashery. Robinson, formerly a bill-sticker,
  wishes to spend the firm's entire capital on advertising, to "broadcast through
  the metropolis." His devotion to inflated and dishonest advertising is the target
  of this amusing comedy which bears all the hallmarks of Trollope's better known
  novels--clever dialogue, riveting moments of drama, and comic suspense.
